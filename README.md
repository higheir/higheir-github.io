# higheir-github.io
this is my website's files made using dreamweaver 8
everything php and that is not supported, but that's
okay with me for once. i moved from neocities because
github seems better. also why do the readme files always
end with .md? i'm kinda new to USING github for CODING,
so...

add me on escargot MSN server:
